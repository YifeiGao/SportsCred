<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sprint 3 Retrospective (CSGAN)</span>

Participants:



*   Everyone attended and participated in the retrospective meeting

Unfinished tasks:



*   None (pb.md has been updated)

What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint?



*   This sprint we decided to open new channels on discord for each individual user story. This proved to be a good decision as everytime one of us worked on our tasks and had new updates they would be able to explain the new updates or features they implemented. In general everyone would give a summary of what they implemented during stand up (very high-level) and then note down the specifics (low-level details) in the channel designated for each story. This way we don’t cluster a bunch of random updates together. This reinforced organization and in turn more productive output from each individual
*   Another important practice that proved to be very useful was having at least 2 people review each pull request. Each person should test on a different system to ensure that the end-to-end flow is fully working. Each person also ensures that all of the criteria of satisfaction that are mentioned in the story are satisfied. Not only does this enforce proper functionality of each story but it also familiarizes the person with the new feature as they would not normally delve into the implementation details otherwise

What are some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint?



*   Going forward we might want to utilize pair programming more consistently. We bring this up because sometimes new features or stories can be implemented using similar convention to previous stories. I.e, they might use the same concepts or workflows that other people have used to implement other features. This way we can avoid people reinventing something that has already been developed. Not only will this allow for consistent programming conventions across the entire application but it will once again lead to more efficient and productive outputs from each one of us
*   Building off the previous point, if one does end up following a convention already implemented it is important for that person that programmed the previous implementation to sufficiently document their code. This way the next person will not have to juggle around what different pieces of code represent. Once again this will lead to a more efficient development environment

What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint?



*   It is important that we do not leave adding/modifying content in our system design documents to the end. It seems that there is a trend in which we program our features and then realize we have to add documentation to our system design a couple of days before submission. It is important that we modify system design documents while our knowledge on our implementations is still FRESH. This way we can derive more sensical explanations in our system design documents. Once again this saves us time as we no longer have to juggle between old code when adding to the system design documents.

What was your best/worst experience during the previous sprint?



*   After discussing with the group we decided:
*   Best experience: We can all agree that after sprint 3, the majority of the functionality of the app was already implemented. This gave us a big sense of relief as we know that we have achieved the minimum to uphold the requirements of the product owners. We knew that going forward from here, anything we do would only make our application better and better!
*   Worst experience: There wasn’t a particular experience that caused us headaches but we were phased by the overall idea that our next sprint is our last one (oh no!). We have developed a good sense of how everyone in our team operates and some of us have even formed friendships. It is upsetting to think about things like these,but just as all other great things, it must come to an unfortunate end after the next sprint.

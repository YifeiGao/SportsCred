## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sprint 2 Retrospective (CSGAN)</span>

**Participants:**



*   Everyone attended the demo meeting.

**Unfinished tasks this sprint:**



*   None (Updated pb.md)

**What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint?**



*   Good communication has served us well thus far. We find that our team communicates very well. In particular our team members express opinions when required and everyone understands the points presented by others. We always make a collective effort when it comes to making decisions for stories, tasks, and types of implementations. We don’t have any disagreements and when we do, we talk it out and bring up the pros and cons of each team member’s approach. If we continue this line of communication going forward in our project, our team members will feel confident which in turn results in a better product
*   Time management is another important aspect for us. During our daily stand ups it is clear that each team member stays on track with their task. Although at times there are days when there aren’t many updates, this is because members are dealing with more immediate tasks for other courses. The fact that they decide to have no updates and leave the work for the next day is calculated. We don’t leave work for the last second, instead we gradually work on our stories. This also allows for a better understanding of the product and hence a better implementation of functionality. Going forward, time management is going to be very critical.

**What are some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint?**



*   For our next sprints, we think it is important to have a more clearly defined workflow. At the beginning of our sprint we should outline a procedure for completing work. We should create a systematic and organized way for a developer to do their work from start to end without having to message other team members on how to perform certain tasks or what to do next. I.e, 1. Make a new branch and name it accordingly to the user story 2. Constantly commit and push with user story ID and appropriate comments 3. After testing, create a PR and have others review it 4. Add/modify existing CRC cards
*   Another practice we should incorporate is to set dates for when everyone should finish their individual work by so that we can start integrating and combining work appropriately to prepare for the demo for the TAs and product owners

**What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint?**



*   There were no particularly harmful practices that were committed during the sprint, but there were some things we can improve on. For instance, all team members must ensure that complete testing is done before moving on to integration. If there are minor problems that occur before integration it will only make the integrated functionality even more vulnerable to problems. Quality assurance is something that must be prioritized moving forward in the project

**What was your best/worst experience during the previous sprint?**



*   After discussing with the group we decided:
*   Best experience: We all agreed that presenting a functioning demo to the TA and the product owners felt amazing. Not only was it nice to see that our work is complete and working at an ideal standard, it was also nice to hear the product owners giving positive feedback on our progress. This is definitely a confidence boost going into the next sprint
*   Worst experience: Integration! Combining everyone's work was a real mess at first. Every person programs differently and so it got a bit complicated when combining the work. It is not as simple as merging the pulling request, there is much more work to do behind the scenes. This is why it is important to dedicate a lot of time for integration

## Meeting goal

During our sprint 2 planning meeting we identified our goals for sprint 2, selected the user stories to be completed, estimated each of the stories using the Fibonacci scale, and assigned tasks to team members

## Sprint 2 goal

Having now layed out the foundations for our application, we can start adding extensions to the skeleton of our app. This will include additional interactivity within open court where users would actually be able to communicate with each other. We would also like to add sharing functionality where we can share SportCred content to outside apps and share outside app content (Facebook and Twitter) to SportCred. We are also focusing on finishing up single player Trivia functionality as well as add the core functionality for making picks and predictions. We also intend on being able to initiate debate threads.

## Sprint 2 user stories

We picked 6 stories for Sprint 2 and broke them down into subtasks (back-end, front-end related subtasks and CRC cards related subtasks). These stories build on the functionality of Sprint 1’s stories (with the exception of picks and predictions which is just being added).

Each team member has 1 story to complete (The picks and predictions story will be shared by 2 team members as it is a larger story). We aimed to distribute work equally, but more importantly we aimed to assign stories based on what each team member already worked on so far in the project. For example, it would make more sense for someone who worked on open court in Sprint 1 to continue building it in Sprint 2. This way we are more efficient with completion times as the team member is more familiar with the underlying processes. Each story ranged from 5 to 20 points to accomplish. The total team capacity is 59 points.

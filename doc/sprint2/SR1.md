## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sprint 1 Retrospective (CSGAN)</span>

**What went well in the sprint?**



*   All assigned stories were completed.
*   Everyone communicated very well. Whenever a team member needed to talk to another, the other team member was always responsive within a reasonable amount of time (as stated in the team contract from sprint 0).
    *   Everyone positively contributed to sprint meetings
    *   Everyone attended and brought up valuable discussion points during daily stand ups
    *   People were always available to talk even outside of these scheduled meetings so that in case of an urgent issue, everyone was on standby if necessary
    *   In general when there were problems, we were able to solve them in a very quick and efficient way. There were not many disagreements between team members.
*   The success of this sprint allowed for a very sound foundation for our future sprints. Extending the functionality of this app will now be easier as the core has been set up. We also gained valuable insight into how our tech stack and these procedures in general work. This will allow for more productive future sprints.

**What could be improved?**



*   By the end of our first sprint we realized that we may have taken up too much work. Although we were able to finish all the work we assigned ourselves by the end of the sprint, it took up too much time of our working days. Realistically, any amount of work can be completed within a deadline, but it is important to ensure that this is a reasonable amount of work so that the team doesn’t rush and instead produces a great looking product (once again we’re not saying our product looks bad- because it doesn’t; we just need to distribute work more evenly)
*   We could set up a meeting for integration. In this first sprint we underestimated the time it would take to integrate everyone’s work together. It takes a look of precision and focus to merge everyone's work together both on the front end and back end. By having an integration meeting we can all work synchronously to combine all of our working features into one working product. This will allow us to present an end-to-end demo to the product owners

**What will we commit to improve in the next sprint?**



*   Before working on future sprints it is important that everyone has a high-level understanding of the features or any type of work they plan to complete. This includes talking to team members, talking to the professor, talking to the TAs, talking to the product owners, and even making graphical design workflows (if necessary)
*   During our future sprints, each team member (or this can be completed as a team) must look over the rubric. This will allow us to understand what the product owners and TAs are looking for. Not only will this provide us a guide but it will also provide us a boost of confidence as everyone will know they are on the right track
*   Most importantly, we must take advantage of our resources. Not only do we have the internet at our disposal but we also have experienced TAs who dedicate a lot of time into making sure that they serve us well. They are there to ask questions, utilize them!

During Sprint 1 Planning Meeting we identified Sprint 1 goal, selected the user stories to be completed, estimated each one using Fibonacci scale and assigned tasks to team members.

## Sprint 1 goal

The goal for Sprint 1 is to create a prototype of application with basic social network type functionality. 
After sprint 1 user will be able to create and interact with his or her account (sign up, login, log out, view and modify profile) and perform some user-to-user interaction
(search for other users, post to open court and see other people's posts).

## Sprint 1 user stories

We picked 8 user stories for Sprint 1 and broke them down into subtasks (back-end, front-end related subtasks and CRC cards related subtask). The stories selected would provide basic social network type experience for the user.

Each team member has 1 or 2 entire user stories to complete during Sprint 1. We aimed to distribute workload equally, but we also took into account that some of the team members are more familiar with the tech stack than others or have done similar tasks in past.
After distributing workload, each team member has 8 to 13 pts to accomplish. The total team capacity is 81 pts.

## Meeting summary

We had two release planning meetings. 
In the first meeting, we lighlty disucssed which featuers should be tackled on each of the four sprints. We sorted the features based on priority, workload and their dependecy on other features.

Initally, we had set our release goal for the first sprint to be relatively less ambitious than the sprints, as some members were not complelty familiar with React (our front-end framework) and no one in our team had any experince with Chi (our back-end framework). However, we realized half of sprint 1 would fall on reading week, so we had a second meeting, where we increased the number of features we planned to relase in the first sprint. We all agreed that we could spend more time on the project during reading week. We decided on adding more foundational features related to user's profile and trivia to sprint 1, while shifting subsequent features up one sprint to evenly divide the work load.

## Meeting summary

We had two release planning meetings. 
In the first meeting, we lighlty disucssed which featuers should be tackled on each of the four sprints. We sorted the features based on priority, workload and their dependecy on other features.

Initally, we had set our release goal for the first sprint to be relatively less ambitious than the sprints, as some members were not complelty familiar with React (our front-end framework) and no one in our team had any experince with Chi (our back-end framework). However, we realized half of sprint 1 would fall on reading week, so we had a second meeting, where we increased the number of features we planned to relase in the first sprint. We all agreed that we could spend more time on the project during reading week. We decided on adding more foundational features related to user's profile and trivia to sprint 1, while shifting subsequent features up one sprint to evenly divide the work load.

Since we release a new verison of our product every sprint, our release plan will be dictated by our plan for the coming sprints.
  
### sprint 1
- sign up/log in/log out
  - This is a required functionality, users must be able to create accounts, log in and log out. Every other functionality, such as being able to post comments, play trivia or start debates, requires the that the user first have an account. So we've decided to complete that feature in or current sprint. 
  - As a regular user, I want to create an account with email to use the app 
  - As a regular user, I want to login with email and password, so that I can use the app. 
  - As a regular user, I want to logout of the app, so that I can prevent other computer users from having access to my account.
- post/browse on OpenCourt
  - We decided to put OpenCourt in our first sprint because it isn't dependent on any other feature except the sign up/log in. It's also relatively simple to implement.
  - As a regular user, I want to post on the open court to express my opinion on a sport event.
  - As a regular user, I want to view and scroll past posts to gain perspective on other people’s opinions.

  - SportsCred has a key socail media aspect, that allows its users to connect with each other.

This is another foundational feature, which is why we've put it in the first sprint.

## Introduction:
Sportscred is a social media and a sports analysis app that allows users to prove their predictions to their friends and increase their prediction skills as represented by their ACS.
## Competition 1:
Sports betting apps:
* theScore.bet
* Fanduel
* Draftkings

These apps are sports media and betting apps that provide users with a live feed of the latest news, stats, and betting information of their favorite sports teams. Similar to SportsCred, these apps are perfect for hardcore sports fans who wish to prove their sports knowledge while also earning money.

SportsCred is different from these apps because it offers a social media style platform while the competition does not. However both platforms allow users to prove their predictions. One gives credit and proof of one’s competence, and the other gives monetary reward as proof of one’s competence.

In addition, these apps also give users live information on their sports teams and predictions. Users can make daily picks, and betting over several days. Sportscred also offers a similar feature. Sportscred will provide live info about the latest predictions and allows predictions over a wide variety of sports.
## Competition 2:
Social media apps:
* Instagram
* Facebook
* Reddit

Competition 2 are social media apps in which people have created sports related factions. On these social media apps, a user who has specifically subscribed to sports content should be able to see the latest predictions and sports information. Sports fans can also debate among themselves, create posts, comment, like, dislike, have messages with friends, etc. In addition most social media sites support live streaming, so sports fans can watch their favorite game in real time as it's happening.

Unfortunately, unless a user spends time to learn how to use a social media app to attain only the sports information they desire, it becomes quite difficult to sift through the vast array of other unrelated content. Also, since information is not released by a verified source, it is possible that users will get false or incorrect information from independent sports channels. And finally, there is no user attribution. Usually users who have the largest following will be able to speak the loudest, regardless of their expertise level.

SportsCred targets these issues in their app. Sportscred only provides the latest information from verified sources. SportsCred also allows users to make posts, debate, and talk among themselves about the latest and greatest games. In Addition, SportsCred makes it easy to find the information that you want, about the sports you want. SportsCred also shows users their ACS score which is verified proof of a user’s skill in predictions. Instead of popular users getting credit, the users with the best knowledge will always be on top.

## Conclusion
Overall, SportsCred offers two distinct things that are not offered by any social media or betting platform out there: A social media style app, that also promotes discussion and competition, a combination of the competitive scene in betting apps, with the friendliness of facebook or instagram. There is nothing like it out there because no site is dedicated solely to sports debates.

SportsCred targets an audience that ranges from sports newbies to hardcore fans. SportsCred brings in users who want to see the right predictions, and users who make the best predictions. Furthermore, SportsCred works like a social media app, and transitioning to be a SportsCred user would be easy for any social media veteran.
